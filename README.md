# small-mini-game-in-cpp-using-sfml-and-oop
this is a game, I called it "fire game", in this project there are different principles of OOP of the C ++ language, its various methods and functions. There is also work with the sfml library.
I would like to add to my words that in this project it is necessary to add (to ur project) all files except main, like header file,and main like common cpp file .
